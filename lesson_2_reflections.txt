What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Now I have a repository where I can commit my project process. I need this for 
a good control on my developments.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area I can put files that I may modify. It is good because I don't need to worry about configuration files in my projecto, for example.
